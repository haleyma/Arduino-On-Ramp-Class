# ARDUINO ON RAMP
Go from ZERO to ONE learning to use the Arduino environment to build electronics projects. Class will review development boards, software and basic electronic components while walking the group through a project.

The goal of this class is to introduce a beginner to the world of micro-electronics' development boards, get you started with the software, discuss how to control a few components, put together a straight forward project, and highlight a few available resources so that each participant has some direction on next actions they can take to learn more, build more, connect more when they leave.
